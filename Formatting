Problem:  Display a table of processes that includes only the process names, IDs, and whether or not they’re responding to Windows (the Responding property has that information). Have the table take up as little horizontal room as possible, but don’t allow any information to be truncated.
Solution: >>> Get-Process | Format-Table Name, Id, Responding -AutoSize

Problem:  Display a table of processes that includes the process names and IDs. Also include columns for virtual and physical memory usage, expressing those values in megabytes (MB).
Solution: >>> Get-Process | Format-Table Name, Id, @{l='VM(MB)';e={$_.VM/1MB -as[int]}}, @{l='PM(MB)';e={$_.PM/1MB -as[int]}}

Problem:  Use Get-EventLog to display a list of available event logs. (Hint: You’ll need to read the help to learn the correct parameter to accomplish that.) Format the output as a table that includes, in this order, the log display name and the retention period. The column headers must be “LogName” and “RetDays.”
Solution: >>> Get-EventLog -List | Format-Table @{l='LogName';e={$_.Log}}, @{l='RetDays';e={$_.MinimumRetentionDays}}

Problem:  Display a list of services so that a separate table is displayed for services that are started and services that are stopped. Services that are started should be displayed first. (Hint: You’ll use a -groupBy parameter)
Solution: >>>  get-service | Sort-Object Status -Descending | Format-Table -GroupBy status
